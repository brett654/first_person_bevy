Using the bevy engine to create a first person experience where I can load assets.

TODOS:
- implement collisions
- Have quake style movement
- Use a panel with perlin noise for generating terrain instead of a glb file

Issues:
- assets not render all verticies(due to UV layers not supported)
  - Solution:
    - make own assets
